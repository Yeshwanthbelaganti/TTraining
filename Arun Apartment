Arun is living in an apartment, his grandfather reading a newspaper and he catch some task for Arun. There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top.
Arun can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. the task is to count the number of ways, arun can reach the top.
For Ex:
Input: n = 4
Output: 5
(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include<stdio.h> 
int countWays(int n, int m) { 
	int res[n+1]; 
	int temp = 0; 
	res[0] = 1; 
	for (int i=1; i <= n; i++) { 
		int s = i - m - 1; 
		int e = i - 1; 
		if (s >= 0) { 
			temp -= res[s]; 
		} 
		temp += res[e]; 
		res[i] = temp; 
	} 
	return res[n]; 
} 

// main function to test countWays function: 
int main () { 
	int n, m = 2; 
	scanf("%d",&n);
	printf("%d",countWays(n, m)); 
	return 0; 
}
