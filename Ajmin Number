Chandra wants to know the count of n digit special Ajmin number. A number is a called Ajmin number if all adjacent digits have an absolute difference of 1.
321 is a Stepping Number while 421 is not.
For Ex:
Input : 2 
Output : 17
Explanation: The numbers are 10, 12, 21, 23, 32, 34, 43, 45, 54, 56, 65, 67, 76, 78, 87, 89, 98.
