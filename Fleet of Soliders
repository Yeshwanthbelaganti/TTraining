Consider a fleet of soldiers of a country are being assembled for a rehearsal session, the enemy country secretly surrounded them and has a special strategy to kill the soldiers in a particular pattern.
Assume that the soldiers are standing in a single straight line. The enemies will repeatedly scan through this line and kill soldiers who are all matching the given pattern.
Find the list of soldiers who are surviving at last or find if all of them are killed.
Here soldiers are represented as alpha-numeric letters, irrespective of cases.
Implement "FindRemainingSoldiers" class with "defeatSoldiers(String soldiers, String pattern)" method to find the left out soldiers if any, else print "Defeat" as result.
Example:
soldiers: xAbcyAAbcbAbccz
pattern: Abc
Iteration:
0: xAbcyAAbcbAbccz
1: xyAAbcbAbccz
2: xyAbAbccz
3: xyAbcz
4: xyz
Output: xyz

import java.util.*;

class FindLeftSoldiers {
  public static String defeatSoldiers(String soldiers, String pattern) {
    while (soldiers.length() > 0) {

        int idx = soldiers.indexOf(pattern);
        if (idx == -1) {
            break;
        }

        soldiers = soldiers.replaceFirst(pattern, "");

    }

    return soldiers;
}    
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        String soldiers = in.next();
        String pattern = in.next();

        in.close();
        
        String result = defeatSoldiers(soldiers, pattern);

        if (result.length() == 0) {
            System.out.println("Defeat");
        } else {
            System.out.println(result);
        }

    }

}
