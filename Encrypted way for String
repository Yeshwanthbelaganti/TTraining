#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char s[100];
    scanf("%s", &s);
     int i=0;
     while(s[i]!='\0')
     {
           if(s[i]=='A')
           {
               s[i]='B';
           }  
           if(s[i]=='a')
           {
               s[i]='@';
           }
           if(s[i]=='1')
           {
               s[i]='2';
           }
           i++; 
     }
         
         printf("%s",s);
 return 0; 
    
}
