Abinesh has two Integers A and B, and he was to print all the terms of the series upto B-terms of the A-bonacci Numbers.
For example, when A = 2, the sequence becomes Fibonacci, when A = 3, sequence becomes Tribonacci.
Input : A = 3, B = 8
Output : 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13
We need to print first B terms.
First three terms are 0, 0 and 1.
Fourth term is 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
Fifth term is 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
Sixth terms is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
Seventh term is 7 (1 + 2 + 4) and eighth
term is 13 (7 + 4 + 2).
Note:
If A=3, the series start with 0,0,1
If A=5, the series start with 0,0,0,0,1
If A=6, the series start with 0,0,0,0,0,1
