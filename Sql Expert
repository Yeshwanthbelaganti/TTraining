Jegan is a SQL expert, he knows the joins, replace and remove operation. But his professor wants him to do this operations in programming language. 
He give a task for him, given a string of any combination of three letters ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’, find length of the smallest string that can be obtained by applying the following operation repeatedly:
Take any two adjacent, distinct characters and replace them with the third.
Input : bcab
Output : 1
Selecting 'bc' and transforming it to 'a' 
leaves us with 'aab'. We can then select
'ab' and transform it to 'c', giving 'ac'. 
This can further be transformed into 'b',
which is of length one.
