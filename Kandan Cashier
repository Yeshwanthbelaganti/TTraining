Kandan is the cashier of a local grocery shop. His owner is a superstitious man who is also very stingy in spending money.
The shop was going under a loss for quite some time and hence Kandan's owner decided to visit an astrologer.
Upon understanding the situation, the astrologer commands him to keep the day to day income of the shop to be a multiple of 6 so that all problems will be solved.
Since it was practically impossible to keep such accounts, the owner orders Kandan to bring the total value at the end of the day as per the astrologer's command by just removing one digit.
If there are many number of possibilities to remove, then the number removed must be in such a way that the total value is greater.
For example. if the total value is 123456, then 3 has to be deleted to get the perfect value
