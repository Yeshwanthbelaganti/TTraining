Swathi register for an online keyboard challenge. The challenge is to print A in the screen.
Key 1: Prints 'A' on screen
Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select screen
Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer
Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed. 
swathi can press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), she has to write a program to produce maximum numbers of A's. 
That is to say, the input parameter is N (No. of keys that she can press), the output is M (No. of A's that you can produce).
For Ex:
Input: N = 11
Output: 27
We can at most get 27 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence.
A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
