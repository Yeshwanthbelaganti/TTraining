Rajesh and Mahesh are brothers, Rajesh give a number n to Mahesh in order to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
For Ex:
Input: n = 1
Output: 2
There are 2 sequences of length 2*n, the sequences are 00 and 11

int countSeq(int n, int diff) 
{ 

	if (abs(diff) > n) 
		return 0; 

	if (n == 1 && diff == 0) 
		return 2; 
	if (n == 1 && abs(diff) == 1) 
		return 1; 

	int res = countSeq(n-1, diff+1) + 2*countSeq(n-1, diff) + countSeq(n-1, diff-1); 

	return res;

	cout << countSeq(n, 0); 
	return 0;
