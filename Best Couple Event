"Shades" Television Channel organizes a fun-filled event named "Best Couple 2020", where in married couples would be invited and given many tasks and activities. 
Based on some criteria decided by the jury, a best couple will be chosen.
N couples registered for the event and each couple was given a registration number(it may repeat). One specific couple's registration Id got missed. 
The event coordinators wanted your help in finding the missing Id.
Write a program which takes an array of registration numbers as input and outputs the missing registration Id.

int main()
{
    int n,i,j,k;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int a[n];
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
    }
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(a[i]>0){k=a[i];
        for(j=i+1;j<n;j++)
        {
            if(k==a[j]){a[j]=0;break;}
            if(j==n-1){n=0;break;}
        }}
        if(n==0){break;}
    }
    printf("%d",k);
    return 0;
