Sathya and Vijay are cousins, they are playing a game. At the beginning there are n coins. Given two more numbers x and y. In each move a player can pick x or y or 1 coins. 
Sathya always starts the game. The player who picks the last coin wins the game. 
For a given value of n, find whether Sathya will win the game or not if both are playing optimally.
For Ex:
Input : n = 5, x = 3, y = 4
Output : Sathya
There are 5 coins, every player can pick 1 or 3 or 4 coins on his/her turn.Sathya can win by picking 3 coins in first chance.
Now 2 coins will be left so Vijay will pick one coin and now Sathya can win by picking the last coin.
