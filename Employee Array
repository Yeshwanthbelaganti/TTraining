Write a program that uses the following arrays:
empId[7]: An array of seven long integers to hold employee identification numbers. The array should be initialized with the following numbers:
5658845   4520125    7895122         8777541        8451277          1302850            7580489
hours[7]: An array of seven integers to hold the number of hours worked by each mployee
payRate[7] : An array of seven doubles to hold each employee’s hourly pay rate
wages[7]: An array of seven doubles to hold each employee’s gross wages
The program should relate the data in each array through the subscripts.
For example, the number in element 0 of the hours array should be the number of hours worked by the employee whose identification number is stored in element 0 of the empId array.
That same employee’s pay rate should be stored in element 0 of the payRate array.
It should then calculate the gross wages for that employee (hours times pay rate) and store them in the wages array. 
After the data has been entered for all the employees, the program should display each employee’s identification number and gross wages.

#include<stdio.h>
int main ()
{
    long long int empid[7];
    int hours[7],i,count = 0;
    double payrate[7],wages[7];
    for(i=0;i<7;i++) {
        scanf("%llu%d%lf",&empid[i],&hours[i],&payrate[i]);
        count++;
    }
    for(i=0;i<7;i++) {
        wages[i] = hours[i]*payrate[i];
        printf("%llu %.2lf\n",empid[i],wages[i]);
    }
}
