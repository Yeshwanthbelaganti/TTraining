Priya has n numbers in her bucket, the professor assigned one task to her.
The task is she wants to count the number of ways to arrange the first N natural numbers in a line such that the left-most number is always 1 and no two consecutive numbers have an absolute difference greater than 2.
For Ex:
Input: N = 4
Output: 4
The only possible arrangements are (1, 2, 3, 4),(1, 2, 4, 3), (1, 3, 4, 2) and (1, 3, 2, 4). Difference between the absolute number is not greater than 2 for any set.

int countWays(int n) 
{ 
	//array initialization 
	int dp[n + 1]; 

	//base cases
	dp[0] = 0; 
	dp[1] = 1; 
	dp[2] = 1; 

	for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) { 
		dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 3] + 1; 
	} 

	return dp[n]; 
} 

// main function
int main() 
{ 
	int n;
	cin>>n;

	cout << countWays(n); 

	return 0; 
}
